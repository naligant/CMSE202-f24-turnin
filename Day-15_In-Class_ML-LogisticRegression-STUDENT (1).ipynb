Extracting features from our data can sometimes be one of the trickier parts of the process and also one of the most important ones. We have to think carefully about exactly what the \"right\" features are for training our machine learning algorithm and, when possible, it is advantageous to find ways to reduce the total number of features we are trying to model. Once we define our features, we can build our model."

    "What is interesting about that curve is that all values of x are mapped into the range for y of 0.0-1.0. Assuming you have a binary classifier, that is one that only has two class labels, that is the mapping you want: all combination of features map into the two class labels 0, or 1. Moreover, the graph looks a lot like a [cumulative probability distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cumulative_distribution_function). The probability that a set of features is of class 1 is 1 to the right and 0 to the left. As you watched in the pre-class video, this is the basis for logistic regression.\n",

    "\n",
    "Note, very importantly, the use of `sm.add_constant` on the training vectors. We talked about that when we did OLS in statsmodels. That column of constant is what the $b_{0}$ or intercept will train against. We need that column to get an intercept. (Note that this code requires that you used `train_labels` and `train_vectors` when you did the train-test split earlier)"
